CDDA Lightsaber Construction

+ Outer Casing
+ Power Assembly [Power Cell, Field Conductor, Vortex Ring, Power Insulator, Energy Gate, Recharge Socket]
+ Focusing Crystal Chamber and Assembly
+ Lightsaber Emitter [ Blade Energy Channel, Cycling Field Energisers, Energy Modulation Circuits, Focusing Lens, Emitter Matrix, High Energy Flux Aperture]
+ Controls

then mods  
[Dual-Phase Mechanism, Lock-On Activation Switch, Pressure Grip/Deadmanâ€™s Switch, Force-Manipulated Switch, Cell Recogniser, CommLink, Dataport]

would be a *massive undertaking* to create one
